# Technical

Collection is built using technologies that I'm not used to on my day job, and as such will probably will make me produce really ugly code. Which is fine, I'm trying to learn.

I'm going to use Electron for the complete development of the initial version of Collection, and if everything goes well, it will probably be split into a client-server architecture while maintaining backwards compatibility.

My goal is to create a completely offline application that can run without the need of an Internet connection. We'll see how Electron holds up to the task.

(If everything goes south, I'll run back crying to JavaFX or C# ðŸ˜Š)
